    "The source base for *A Gospel of Health and Salvation* is the collection of scanned periodicals produced by the [Office of Archives, Statistics, and Research](http://documents.adventistarchives.org/) of the Seventh-day Adventist Church (SDA). That this collection of documents is openly available on the web has been fundamental to the success of this project. One of the greatest challenges for historical scholarship that seeks to leverage large digital collections is access to the relevant materials. While projects such as [Chronicling America](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) and resources such as the [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la) are indispensable, many specialized resources are available only through proprietary databases and library subscriptions that impose limits on the ways scholars can interact with their resources.[^1] \n",
    "\n",
    "The publishing of the digital periodicals on the open web by the SDA made it unnecessary for me to navigate through the firewalls (and legal land-mines) of using text from major library databases, a major boon for the digital project.[^3] And, although the site does not provide an API for accessing the documents, the structure of the pages is regular, making the site a good candidate for web scraping. However, relying on an organization to provide its own historical documents raises its own challenges. Due to the interests of the hosting organization, in this case the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the collection is shaped by and shapes a particular narrative of the denomination's history and development. For example, issues of *Good Health*, which was published by John Harvey Kellogg, are (almost entirely) dropped from the SDA's collection after 1907, which corresponds to the point when Kellogg was disfellowshipped from the denomination, even though Kellogg continued its publication into the 1940s.[^2] Such interests do not invalidate the usefulness of the collection, as all archives have limitations and goals, but those interests need to be acknowledged and taken into account in the analysis.\n",

    "As this was my first technical task for the dissertation, my initial methods for identifying the URLs for the documents I wanted to download was rather manual. I saved an .html file for each index page that contained documents I wanted to download. I then passed those .html files to a script (similar to that recorded here) that used `BeautifulSoup` to extract the PDF ids, reconstruct the URLs, and write the URLs to a new text file, `scrapeList.txt`. After manually deleting the URLs to any documents that were out of range, I then passed the `scrapeList.txt` file to `wget` using the following syntax:[^4] \n",
