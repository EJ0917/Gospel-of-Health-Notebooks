In the process of corpus creation, I filtered the tokens on each page, excluding both low frequency (words occurring in fewer than 20 documents) and high frequency (words occurring in more than 30% of all documents) words. In other words, don't read anything into the fact that \"God\" is missing from the model. I have modeled the most distinctive words for each page.\n",

    "The first strategy I found for aggregating topic weights is to average the topic weights per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "The average topic weight is computed by adding all of the weights for a given topic in a time period and dividing by the total number of documents in that time period. This gives us the average weight of the topic over all documents in the corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "One complication I encountered while work through this is while MALLET reports a weight (be it ever so small) for each topic for all the documents, Gensim by default drops topic information for a document if the weight is under 0.01. This presents a wrinkle for computing averages from Gensim-produced data, as the data needs be expanded before we can compute the average weight of a topic over the corpus (rather than the average over its significant appearances). To do that, I added a 0 value for the missing topic values during the normalizing steps above."

For more control of the calculation, we can also compute the averages externally."
